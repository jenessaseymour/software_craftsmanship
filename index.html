<p>Software Craftsmanship is the study and practice of using computers as a tool in
our everyday lives. Today's world is deeply and critically tied to the computers
we use, in subtle and varied ways few would even begin to consider. At the same
time, the computer sitting on your desk offers a fantastic opportunity to parse
and trove your data. People in nearly every profession could stand to benefit
from the knowledge and ability to write programs to solve their own problems.
This book shows the layperson how to tap this potential, taking you from being
able to perform basic computing tasks, through writing your first program, on to
having a basic understanding of how programs work, while being able to begin to
understand the programs that are used in your profession.</p>
